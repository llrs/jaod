        "The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous
        insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and
        avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development
        and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), a native
        insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce
        in most species of Pinus throughout its native range. However, mountain pine
        beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), despite
        recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the
        high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for
        a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable
        insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability
        for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut
        bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species,
        limber (P. flexilis) and lodgepole (P. contorta) pines with adult mountain
        pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential
        for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different
        areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within
        and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain
        pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree
        species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine,
        regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance
        in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low
        mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship
        suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle

        Background Linkage among genes experiencing different selection pressures
        can make natural selection less efficient. Theory predicts that when local
        adaptation is driven by complex and non-covarying stresses, increased linkage
        is favored for alleles with similar pleiotropic effects, with increased recombination
        favored among alleles with contrasting pleiotropic effects. Here, we introduce
        a framework to test these predictions with a co-association network analysis,
        which clusters loci based on differing associations. We use this framework
        to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation to climate in lodgepole
        pine, Pinus contorta, based on associations with environments. Results We
        identify many clusters of candidate genes and SNPs associated with distinct
        environments, including aspects of aridity and freezing, and discover low
        recombination rates among some candidate genes in different clusters. Only
        a few genes contain SNPs with effects on more than one distinct aspect of
        climate. There is limited correspondence between co-association networks and
        gene regulatory networks. We further show how associations with environmental
        principal components can lead to misinterpretation. Finally, simulations illustrate
        both benefits and caveats of co-association networks. Conclusions Our results
        support the prediction that different selection pressures favor the evolution
        of distinct groups of genes, each associating with a different aspect of climate.
        But our results went against the prediction that loci experiencing different
        sources of selection would have high recombination among them. These results
        give new insight into evolutionary debates about the extent of modularity,
        pleiotropy, and linkage in the evolution of genetic architectures.", "title":

        pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) co-occur in the southern Rocky Mountains
        (USA), where mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) has caused
        extensive lodgepole pine mortality since the late 1990s. Both species excel
        in post-disturbance high-light environments, but lodgepole pine has generally
        been thought to establish poorly on undisturbed seedbeds, and aspen suckering
        may be inhibited by intact aspen overstory. We ask whether lodgepole pine
        and aspen will regenerate in sufficient quantities to revegetate these forests.
        We visited a random sample of aspen and lodgepole pine stands across the affected
        landscape in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming to measure regeneration
        and overstory mortality. Lodgepole pine regeneration is occurring in 85% of
        stands, and most stands have &gt;550 stems ha&minus;1. The median aspen sucker
        density was 6175 stems ha&minus;1. Surprisingly, neither lodgepole pine nor
        aspen regeneration density was related to overstory mortality level. Animal
        damage is currently affecting aspen in these forests. Over 50% of stands had
        damage to 60% or more of their suckers, but 30% of stands had &lt;20% of their
        stems damaged. Browsed stems were significantly shorter for their ages and
        were shorter than the 2.5-m height threshold for possible elk browsing. However,
        the results suggest that sufficient quantities of down lodgepole pine may
        protect aspen from damage and allow aspen to successfully recruit to the overstory.
        Multiple regression analysis showed that down lodgepole pine basal area, followed
        by browsing pressure, were the most important predictors of sucker height
        and the proportion of suckers browsed. Although 15% of stands had no lodgepole
        pine regeneration, aspen and lodgepole pine forests are generally regenerating
        despite animal browsing on aspen. This study is the first to present a regional
        perspective on regeneration in MPB-affected lodgepole pine and aspen forests,
        and overall, intervention does not seem necessary to ensure a mix of both

        species, suggesting S. coniferarum feeds on multiple adelgid species. More
        S. coniferarum were found on pine than hemlock. DNA barcoding of S. coniferarum
        found two distinct clusters that differed by 6% divergence. Beetles in each
        cluster were co-habiting the same conifer species, and they could not be distinguished
        morphologically. Further taxonomic studies are needed to understand the significance
        of DNA barcode sequence divergence. Because S. coniferarum was more frequently
        associated with pine adelgids than HWA, and because of remaining taxonomic
        uncertainty, S. coniferarum may not be suitable for HWA biological control.",

        "The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous
        insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and
        avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development
        and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), a native
        insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce
        in most species of Pinus throughout its native range. However, mountain pine
        beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), despite
        recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the
        high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for
        a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable
        insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability
        for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut
        bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species,
        limber (P. flexilis) and lodgepole (P. contorta) pines with adult mountain
        pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential
        for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different
        areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within
        and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain
        pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree
        species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine,
        regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance
        in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low
        mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship
        suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle
        is likely to be retained through climate-driven high-elevation mountain pine

        "Increased mortality of forest trees, driven directly or indirectly by climate
        change, is occurring around the world. In western North America, whitebark
        pine, a high elevation keystone species, and lodgepole pine, a widespread
        ecologically and economically important tree, have experienced extensive mortality
        in recent climate-driven outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle. However, even
        in stands experiencing high levels of mortality, some mature trees have survived.
        We hypothesized that the outbreak acted as a natural selection event, removing
        trees most susceptible to the beetle and least adapted to warmer drier conditions.
        If this was the case, genetic change would be expected at loci underlying
        beetle resistance. Given we did not know the basis for resistance, we used
        inter-simple sequence repeats to compare the genetic profiles of two sets
        of trees, survivors (mature, living trees) and general population (trees just
        under the diameter preferred by the beetles and expected to approximate the
        genetic structure of each tree species at the site without beetle selection).
        This method detects high levels of polymorphism and has often been able to
        detect patterns associated with phenotypic traits. For both whitebark and
        lodgepole pine, survivors and general population trees mostly segregated independently
        indicating a genetic basis for survivorship. Exceptions were a few general
        population trees that segregated with survivors in proportions roughly reflecting
        the proportion of survivors versus beetle-killed trees. Our results indicate
        that during outbreaks, beetle choice may result in strong selection for trees
        with greater resistance to attack. Our findings suggest that survivorship
        is genetically based and, thus, heritable. Therefore, retaining survivors
        after outbreaks to act as primary seed sources could act to promote adaptation.
        Further research will be needed to characterize the actual mechanism(s) of
        resistance.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Plant culture", "code":

        "Insufficient chilling resulting from rising winter temperatures associated
        with climate warming has been an area of particular interest in boreal and
        temperate regions where a period of cool temperatures in fall and winter is
        required to break plant dormancy. In this study, we examined the budburst
        and growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar
        (Populus balsamifera L.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), black spruce
        (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss),
        jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.
        ex. Loud.) seedlings subjected to typical northern Ontario, Canada, spring
        conditions in climate chambers after different exposures to natural chilling.
        Results indicate that chilling requirements (cumulative weighted chilling
        hours) differed substantially among the seven species, ranging from 300 to
        500 h for spruce seedlings to more than 1100 h for trembling aspen and lodgepole
        pine. Only spruce seedlings had fulfilled their chilling requirements before
        December 31, whereas the other species continued chilling well into March
        and April. Species with lower chilling requirements needed more heat accumulation
        for budburst and vice versa. Insufficient chilling delayed budburst but only
        extremely restricted chilling hours (&lt;400) resulted in abnormal budburst
        and growth, including reduced needle and shoot expansion, early budburst in
        lower crowns, and erratic budburst on lower stems and roots. Effects, however,
        depended on both the species\u2019 chilling requirements and the chilling\u2013heat
        relationship. Among the seven tree species examined, trembling aspen is most
        likely to be affected by reduced chilling accumulation possible under future
        climate scenarios, followed by balsam poplar, white birch, lodgepole pine,
        and jack pine. Black and white spruce are least likely to be affected by changes

        stress positive effects, others tend to attribute a largely negative influence
        to plantations. One important factor steering the influence on biodiversity
        are management practices. A second important factor is the environmental matrix.
        Chile offers the option to analyse both factors jointly. The coastal range
        of central Chile has experienced rapid and widespread replacement of native
        Nothofagus spp. forests in favour of Pinus radiata plantations. Here, native
        forests remain limited to small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix
        of plantations. Management is rather intensive and not designed to maintain
        biodiversity. While in the coastal range of central Chile the transformation
        from native forests to non-native tree plantations has almost come to an end,
        spatial extension of P. contorta and P. ponderosa plantations has just recently
        begun in Chilean Patagonia. While the management is similar to central Chile,
        plantations rather exist as small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix
        of native plant formations (e.g. Nothofagus spp. forests and Nothofagus spp.
        scrublands). In the framework of this work, effects of the two diametric land
        usages on biodiversity are assessed and compared. Biodiversity is assessed
        at the \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-scale. At the \u03b1-scale, biodiversity
        impacts are inferred statistically, using one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s PostHoc
        test. Biodiversity of plants at both sites is significantly reduced in plantations
        when compared to native forests or scrublands. Plantation forestry lowers
        \u03b1-biodiversity and does not provide additional habitats for specialists.
        At the \u03b2-scale, weak edge effects due to the presence of native forests
        are observed. In total, plantation forestry tends to promote plant invasions
        and impairs the survival of endemics. At the \u03b3-scale, plant species communities
        where predominantly native and endemic in forests, predominantly introduced
        in plantations. Positive effects of the more native environmental matrix in
        Patagonia are not found to be stronger than in central Chile, therefore it
        is concluded that management imposes a much stronger influence. Results show,
        that the biodiversity impacts in Central Chile are transferable to Chilean
        Patagonia, where plantation forestry is increasingly established.", "title":

        of water limitation on tree defense response of mature lodgepole and jack
        pine (Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana) trees in the field. Tree defense
        response was initiated by inoculation of trees with the MPB-associated fungus
        Grosmannia clavigera and measured through monoterpene emission from tree boles
        and concentration of defensive compounds in phloem, needles, and necrotic
        tissues. Lodgepole pine generally emitted higher amounts of monoterpenes than
        jack pine; particularly from fungal-inoculated trees. Compared to non-inoculated
        trees, fungal inoculation increased monoterpene emission in both species,
        whereas water treatment had no effect on monoterpene emission. The phloem
        of both pine species contains (-)-\u03b1-pinene, the precursor of the beetle\u2019s

        and the availability of regeneration microsites on the establishment of the

        Spread has occurred from two stands planted at the elevation of the native
        treeline (1347\u20131388 masl) in the 1960s. Most stems established between
        1350 and 1450 masl and <em>P. contorta</em> individuals were found up to 270
        m above the original plantings. Although the population has increased by 180%
        in the last 20 years, population growth rate has been declining. Furthermore,
        comparisons with studies from other mountain ranges around the world and at
        low elevations in New Zealand suggest this is a relatively limited spread.
        Our results suggest that climate variation did not have a significant effect
        on establishment patterns, as opposed to availability of regeneration microsites.
        Soil and alpine mat microsites favoured establishment of<em> P. contorta</em>
        and, although these microsites did not appear to be saturated, microsite availability
        may be an important limiting factor for the spread of <em>P. contorta.</em>

        "We studied bark thickness in the mixed-conifer forest type throughout California.
        Sampling included eight conifer species and covered latitude and elevation
        gradients. The thickness of tree bark at 1.37\u2009m correlated with diameter
        at breast height (DBH) and varied among species. Trees exhibiting more rapid
        growth had slightly thinner bark for a given DBH. Variability in bark thickness
        obscured differences between sample locations. Model predictions for 50\u2009cm
        DBH trees of each species indicated that bark thickness was ranked Calocedrus
        decurrens > Pinus jeffreyi > Pinus lambertiana > Abies concolor > Pseudotsuga
        menziesii > Abies magnifica > Pinus monticola > Pinus contorta. We failed
        to find reasonable agreement between our bark thickness data and existing
        bark thickness regressions used in models predicting fire-induced mortality
        in the mixed-conifer forest type in California. The fire effects software
        systems generally underpredicted bark thickness for most species, which could
        lead to an overprediction in fire-caused tree mortality in California. A model
        for conifers in Oregon predicted that bark was 49% thinner in Abies concolor
        and 37% thicker in Pseudotsuga menziesii than our samples from across California,
        suggesting that more data are needed to validate and refine bark thickness
        equations within existing fire effects models.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC",

        active radiation (PAR), and soil temperature and moisture, and ii) survival
        and growth of planted Austrocedrus chilensis and Nothofagus dombeyi seedlings,
        species which formerly composed the natural forest of the area.\n\nStudy area:
        A 2 ha stand of a Pinus contorta stand in Los Alerces National Park, Argentina
        (42\u00b043\u2019S, 71\u00b043\u2019W, 490 m.a.s.l.). \n\nMaterial and methods:
        The Pinus contorta stand was 25 yr old, 22 m height and 26 cm DBH, presenting
        1000 trees ha-1 of density and 53 m2 ha-1 of basal area. In 2009, rectangular
        and circular gaps were created within the stand and then seedlings were planted.
        During two growing seasons (2010-2011 and 2011-2012), PAR, soil temperature
        and moisture were measured in gaps and understory (control), and seedling
        survival and growth in gaps.\n\nMain results: During both seasons, soil temperature
        did not differ among gaps and control, whereas PAR and soil moisture were
        lower in control than in gaps. Seedling survival was high in all gaps regardless
        of species and season. Seedlings showed higher diameter growth in rectangular
        than in circular gaps.\n\nResearch highlights: Austrocedrus chilensis and
        N. dombeyi seedlings survival is high and their growth slightly affected,
        when planted in differently-sized canopy gaps within a Pinus contorta plantation
        in Patagonia. However, other gap sizes and stand densities should be tested
        before recommending which one shows better results for reconverting monocultures

        Scolytinae), but whether wildfires can trigger outbreaks of species such as
        mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is not well understood.
        We monitored 1173 lodgepole (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Doug.) and 599
        ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Doug. ex Law) pines for three years post-wildfire
        in the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah in an area with locally endemic
        mountain pine beetle. We examined how the degree and type of fire injury influenced
        beetle attacks, brood production, and subsequent tree mortality, and related
        these to beetle population changes over time. Mountain pine beetle population
        levels were high the first two post-fire years in lodgepole pine, and then
        declined. In ponderosa pine, populations declined each year after initial
        post-fire sampling. Compared to trees with strip or failed attacks, mass attacks
        occurred on trees with greater fire injury, in both species. Overall, a higher
        degree of damage to crowns and boles was associated with higher attack rates
        in ponderosa pines, but additional injury was more likely to decrease attack
        rates in lodgepole pines. In lodgepole pine, attacks were initially concentrated
        on fire-injured trees, but during subsequent years beetles attacked substantial
        numbers of uninjured trees. In ponderosa pine, attacks were primarily on injured
        trees each year, although these stands were more heavily burned and had few
        uninjured trees. In total, 46% of all lodgepole and 56% of ponderosa pines
        underwent some degree of attack. Adult brood emergence within caged bole sections
        decreased with increasing bole char in lodgepole pine but increased in ponderosa
        pine, however these relationships did not scale to whole trees. Mountain pine
        beetle populations in both tree species four years post-fire were substantially
        lower than the year after fire, and wildfire did not result in population
        outbreaks.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"},

        "Understory plant communities play critical ecological roles in forest ecosystems.
        Both above- and below-ground ecosystem properties and processes influence
        these communities but relatively little is known about such effects at fine
        (i.e., one to several meters within-stand) scales, particularly for forests
        in which the canopy is dominated by a single species. An improved understanding
        of these effects is critical for understanding how understory biodiversity
        is regulated in such forests and for anticipating impacts of changing disturbance
        regimes. Our primary objective was to examine the patterns of fine-scale variation
        in understory plant communities and their relationships to above- and below-ground
        resource and environmental heterogeneity within mature lodgepole pine forests.
        We assessed composition and diversity of understory vegetation in relation
        to heterogeneity of both the above-ground (canopy tree density, canopy and
        tall shrub basal area and cover, downed wood biomass, litter cover) and below-ground
        (soil nutrient availability, decomposition, forest floor thickness, pH, and
        phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and multiple carbon-source substrate-induced
        respiration (MSIR) of the forest floor microbial community) environment. There
        was notable variation in fine-scale plant community composition; cluster and
        indicator species analyses of the 24 most commonly occurring understory species
        distinguished four assemblages, one for which a pioneer forb species had the
        highest cover levels, and three others that were characterized by different
        bryophyte species having the highest cover. Constrained ordination (distance-based
        redundancy analysis) showed that two above-ground (mean tree diameter, litter
        cover) and eight below-ground (forest floor pH, plant available boron, microbial
        community composition and function as indicated by MSIR and PLFAs) properties
        were associated with variation in understory plant community composition.
        These results provide novel insights into the important ecological associations
        between understory plant community composition and heterogeneity in ecosystem
        properties and processes within forests dominated by a single canopy species.",

        species of similar size and growing conditions. The amount of preformed-ponderosa
        pine oleoresins exuded in 24 h (mg) was almost four times that of lodgepole

        signals are important triggers in the life-cycle transitions\nand play a crucial
        role in the life-history evolution. Yet very little is\nknown about the leading
        ecological factors contributing to the variations of\nlife-history traits
        in perennial plants. This paper explores both the causes\nand consequences
        for the evolution of life-history traits (i.e., seed\ndormancy and size) in
        lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> Dougl.) across British Columbia\n(B.C.),
        Canada. We selected 83 logepole pine populations covering 22\necosystem zones

        generated accordingly for the reference (1961\u20131990)\nand future (2041\u20132070)
        periods. We found that dynamic climatic variables\nrather than constant geographic
        variables are the true environmental driving\nforces in seed dormancy and
        size variations and thus provide reliable\npredictors in response to global
        climate change. Evapotranspiration and\nprecipitation in the plant-to-seed
        chronology are the most critical climate\nvariables for seed dormancy and
        size variations, respectively. Hence, we\npredicted that levels of seed dormancy
        in lodgepole pine would increase\nacross large tracts of B.C. in 2050s. Winter-chilling
        is able to increase\nthe magnitude of life-history plasticity and lower the

        is likely to be\ninsufficient in the north of 49\u00b0\u202fN in 2050s, which

        In this study, torrefaction experiments were conducted on 2-mm ground lodgepole

        and P. sylvestris, but stands of P. abies had higher total species richness.
        However, species richness of lichens in stands of P. abies decreased with
        increasing stand age, while no such age effect was detected for P. contorta
        and P. sylvestris. Lichen species composition progressively diverged with

        P. contorta were influenced by greater basal area, canopy closure, and average

        in lichen species richness and composition were mainly explained by canopy
        closure and habitat availability, and the greater canopy closure in mature
        P. abies stands promoted the colonization and growth of calicioid lichen species.
        Our results indicate that the non-native P. contorta have similar species

        ponderosae) in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada has
        resulted in a landscape consisting of a mosaic of forest stands at different
        stages of mortality. Within forest stands, understory communities are the
        reservoir of the majority of plant species diversity and influence the composition
        of future forests in response to disturbance. Although changes to stand composition
        following beetle outbreaks are well documented, information on immediate responses

        was to examine the effects of D. ponderosae-induced tree mortality on initial
        changes in diversity and productivity of understory plant communities. We
        established a total of 110 1-m2 plots across eleven mature lodgepole pine
        forests to measure changes in understory diversity and productivity as a function
        of tree mortality and below ground resource availability across multiple years.
        Overall, understory community diversity and productivity increased across
        the gradient of increased tree mortality. Richness of herbaceous perennials
        increased with tree mortality as well as soil moisture and nutrient levels.
        In contrast, the diversity of woody perennials did not change across the gradient
        of tree mortality. Understory vegetation, namely herbaceous perennials, showed
        an immediate response to improved growing conditions caused by increases in
        tree mortality. How this increased pulse in understory richness and productivity

        "We developed proteome profiles for host colonizing mountain pine beetle adults,
        Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Adult insects
        were fed in pairs on fresh host lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud,
        phloem tissue. The proteomes of fed individuals were monitored using iTRAQ
        and compared to those of starved beetles, revealing 757 and 739 expressed
        proteins in females and males, respectively, for which quantitative information
        was obtained. Overall functional category distributions were similar for males
        and females, with the majority of proteins falling under carbohydrate metabolism
        (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle), structure (cuticle, muscle,
        cytoskeleton), and protein and amino acid metabolism. Females had 23 proteins
        with levels that changed significantly with feeding (p<0.05, FDR<0.20), including
        chaperones and enzymes required for vitellogenesis. In males, levels of 29
        proteins changed significantly with feeding (p<0.05, FDR<0.20), including
        chaperones as well as motor proteins. Only two proteins, both chaperones,
        exhibited a significant change in both females and males with feeding. Proteins
        with differential accumulation patterns in females exhibited higher fold changes
        with feeding than did those in males. This difference may be due to major
        and rapid physiological changes occurring in females upon finding a host tree
        during the physiological shift from dispersal to reproduction. The significant
        accumulation of chaperone proteins, a cytochrome P450, and a glutathione S-transferase,
        indicate secondary metabolite-induced stress physiology related to chemical
        detoxification during early host colonization. The females'' activation of
        vitellogenin only after encountering a host indicates deliberate partitioning
        of resources and a balancing of the needs of dispersal and reproduction.",
